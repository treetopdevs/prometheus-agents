### Security Considerations
1. **Secret Storage:** All secrets encrypted at rest using AES-256
2. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent brute force attacks on MFA codes
3. **Audit Logging:** All MFA attempts logged for security monitoring
4. **Time Synchronization:** Handle clock drift gracefully
5. **Recovery Mechanisms:** Secure recovery code generation and management

### Performance Requirements
- TOTP verification: <10ms response time
- SMS delivery: <30 seconds
- WebAuthn authentication: <500ms
- Support 10,000 concurrent MFA verifications
- 99.9% uptime requirement

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all cryptographic functions
- Integration tests for SMS delivery
- Load testing for concurrent authentications
- Security testing for timing attacks
- Usability testing for setup flows
```

# COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION GENERATOR

## API DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE

### Authentication API Documentation
**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** 2024-01-15  
**Status:** Production Ready  

#### Overview
The Authentication API provides secure user authentication with support for multiple authentication methods including traditional credentials, multi-factor authentication, and social login providers.

#### Base URL
```
Production: https://api.myapp.com/v2
Staging: https://staging-api.myapp.com/v2
```

#### Authentication Methods
All API endpoints require authentication via JWT Bearer tokens unless otherwise specified.

```bash
# Example authenticated request
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.myapp.com/v2/users/profile
```

#### Rate Limiting
- **Authenticated users:** 1000 requests per hour
- **Unauthenticated users:** 100 requests per hour
- **Rate limit headers included in all responses**

#### Error Handling
All errors follow RFC 7807 Problem Details specification:

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.myapp.com/errors/validation-error",
  "title": "Validation Error", 
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Request validation failed",
  "instance": "/api/v2/users/register",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "code": "INVALID_FORMAT",
      "message": "Email format is invalid"
    }
  ]
}
```

### User Management Endpoints

#### Register New User
```http
POST /api/v2/users/register
```

**Description:** Creates a new user account with email verification.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "terms_accepted": true
}
```

**Validation Rules:**
- `email`: Valid email format, unique in system
- `password`: Minimum 12 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- `first_name`/`last_name`: 1-50 characters, no special characters
- `terms_accepted`: Must be true

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "user_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "status": "pending_verification",
  "verification_token_sent": true,
  "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email for verification."
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: Validation errors
- `409 Conflict`: Email already registered
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(userData)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      const error = await response.json();
      throw new Error(error.detail);
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Registration failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

    try:
        response = requests.post(url, json=user_data, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Registration failed: {e}")
        raise
```

*cURL:*
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.myapp.com/v2/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: High Response Times
**Symptoms:**
- API responses taking >2 seconds
- Database connection timeouts
- High CPU usage on database server

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check API response times
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -s -o /dev/null https://api.myapp.com/health

# Monitor database performance
psql -c "SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Check system resources
kubectl top pods -n production
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Database Optimization:**
   - Add missing indexes for frequent queries
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Enable query result caching
   
2. **Application Optimization:**
