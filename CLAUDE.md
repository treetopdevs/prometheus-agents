# Prometheus Agents - Claude SubAgents Project

**Version: 1.5**

## Project Overview
This project provides 9 PROACTIVE and AGGRESSIVE Claude SubAgents that automatically detect issues and implement comprehensive solutions without asking permission. After a major consolidation from 23 agents (61% reduction), each agent now combines multiple specializations while maintaining zero tolerance for suboptimal code.

**BREAKTHROUGH**: All agents are now PROACTIVE (automatically detect problems) and AGGRESSIVE (fix issues immediately without asking). They intervene when they detect anything suboptimal and implement comprehensive solutions that enforce best practices.

**NEW IN v1.1.0**: Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration! All agents now leverage Serena and other specialized MCPs for enhanced code intelligence and domain-specific capabilities.

**NEW IN v1.1.1**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle enforcement! All agents now follow strict DRY principles during code execution, with shared patterns library and systematic reuse of existing code.

**NEW IN v1.2.0**: Advanced Reasoning Integration! Sequential Thinking systematically activated across all agents with automated trigger patterns and orchestrated workflows for complex decisions.

**NEW IN v1.3.0**: Template Flexibility Enhancement! All agents now support both Surface (.sface) and HEEx (.heex) templating approaches, choosing the appropriate method based on project standards rather than enforcing a specific template engine.

**NEW IN v1.3.1**: Memory Integration Enhancement! Removed standalone Memory MCP and integrated memory functionality directly into Serena MCP using write_memory/read_memory tools for better project knowledge persistence.

**NEW IN v1.3.2**: Global Instructions Integration! Added global CLAUDE.md file to `/global/` directory containing universal Claude Code instructions for task management, git workflows, and code analysis tools. These global instructions now complement project-specific agent behaviors.

**🚀 REVOLUTIONARY IN v1.4.0**: Three-Layer Intelligence Architecture (now streamlined to Two-Layer in v1.5)! All agents operated with comprehensive code intelligence through systematic orchestration of Serena, Zen MCP, and Sequential Thinking.

**🚀 STREAMLINED IN v1.5**: Two-Layer Intelligence Architecture! Simplified from three layers to two for better maintainability while preserving all capabilities. All agents now operate with efficient two-layer intelligence through Serena (semantic code understanding) and Sequential Thinking (complex reasoning). Features streamlined workflows, DRY enforcement, and complexity-based automatic activation. Maintains zero blind spots in code analysis with a cleaner architecture.
