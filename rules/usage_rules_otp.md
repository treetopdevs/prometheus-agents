# OTP Usage Rules

## GenServer Best Practices
- Keep state simple and serializable
- Handle all expected messages explicitly
- Use `handle_continue/2` for post-init work
- Implement proper cleanup in `terminate/2` when necessary

## Process Communication
- Use `GenServer.call/3` for synchronous requests expecting replies
- Use `GenServer.cast/2` for fire-and-forget messages.
- When in doubt, use `call` over `cast`, to ensure back-pressure
- Set appropriate timeouts for `call/3` operations

## Fault Tolerance
- Set up processes such that they can handle crashing and being restarted by supervisors
- Use `:max_restarts` and `:max_seconds` to prevent restart loops

## Task and Async
- Use `Task.Supervisor` for better fault tolerance
- Handle task failures with `Task.yield/2` or `Task.shutdown/2`
- Set appropriate task timeouts
- Use `Task.async_stream/3` for concurrent enumeration with back-pressure
