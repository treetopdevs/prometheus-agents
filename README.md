# Prometheus Agents 🚀

**Version: 1.5 - Revolutionary Two-Layer Intelligence + Phoenix 1.8 & DaisyUI Integration**

The most AGGRESSIVE and PROACTIVE AI agent system ever created for software development. After a revolutionary consolidation from 23 agents to 9 elite agents (61% reduction), each agent now automatically detects problems and implements comprehensive solutions WITHOUT asking permission.

**NEW IN v1.1.0**: Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration! All agents now leverage Serena for semantic code intelligence, Tidewave for Elixir testing, and specialized MCPs for their domains.

**NEW IN v1.1.1**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle enforcement! All agents now follow strict DRY principles during code execution, with shared patterns library and systematic reuse of existing code.

**NEW IN v1.2.0**: Advanced Reasoning Integration! Sequential Thinking and now systematically activated with automated trigger patterns, orchestrated workflows, and multi-model consensus validation for complex decisions.

**NEW IN v1.3.0**: Template Flexibility Enhancement! All agents now support both Surface (.sface) and HEEx (.heex) templating approaches, with enhanced specialization knowledge integrated from domain experts while maintaining consistent tool and model selection.

**NEW IN v1.3.1**: Memory Integration Enhancement! Removed standalone Memory MCP and integrated memory functionality directly into Serena MCP using write_memory/read_memory tools for better project knowledge persistence.

**NEW IN v1.3.2**: Global Instructions Integration! Added universal Claude Code instructions in `/global/CLAUDE.md` covering task delegation, git workflows, and code analysis tools. These global instructions now complement project-specific agent behaviors for unified excellence.

**🚀 REVOLUTIONARY IN v1.4.0**: Two-Layer Intelligence Architecture! All agents now operate with unprecedented code intelligence through systematic orchestration of Serena (semantic code understanding), Zen (16 sophisticated AI analysis tools), and Sequential Thinking (complex reasoning). Features sophisticated intelligence cascades, multi-model consensus validation with 28+ AI models, assumption challenge workflows, and adaptive model selection for different problem types. This creates a comprehensive intelligence system with zero blind spots in code analysis.

**🚀 ENHANCED IN v1.5**: Phoenix 1.8 + DaisyUI Integration! Added comprehensive Phoenix 1.8 capabilities (LiveView Streams, modern navigation, verified routes, enhanced Presence) and complete DaisyUI component system expertise (30+ semantic components, theme management, accessibility features). All agents now have full expertise in modern Phoenix development with sophisticated UI component integration patterns.
